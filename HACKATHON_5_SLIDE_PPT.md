## 📄 **SLIDE 1: THE PROBLEM & SOLUTION** (30 seconds)

### **Title:** 
**"70% of Resumes Are Fake. We Fix That."**

### **Content:**

**Left Side - The Problem:**
- ❌ **70% of resumes contain inflated/false skills**
- ❌ **4-6 hours** to create manual assessments
- ❌ **No way to verify** if candidates actually have claimed skills
- ❌ **Cheating & plagiarism** go undetected

**Right Side - Our Solution:**
- ✅ **AI generates assessments in 60 seconds** from job descriptions
- ✅ **Multi-layer anti-cheat system** prevents cheating
- ✅ **Resume-skill mismatch detection** flags discrepancies automatically
- ✅ **Plagiarism & bot detection** ensures assessment integrity

### **Visual:**

### **Speaker Notes:**
"Imagine hiring someone who claims to be a React expert, but can't write a single line of code. This happens 70% of the time. SkillZen uses AI to automatically create assessments and detect fake applications, saving recruiters 4-6 hours per role while ensuring only qualified candidates get through."

## 📄 **SLIDE 2: HOW IT WORKS** (1 minute)

### **Title:**
**"From Job Description to Assessment in 60 Seconds"**

### **Content:**

**3-Step Process (Visual Flow):**

**Step 1: AI Parses Job Description** 🤖
- Extracts skills, experience level, requirements
- Identifies technical, soft skills, tools
- Suggests assessment topics

**Step 2: AI Generates Questions** ⚡
- **MCQ Questions:** Multiple choice with 4 options
- **Subjective Questions:** Scenario-based prompts
- **Coding Challenges:** Programming problems with test cases
- All aligned with job requirements

**Step 3: Smart Evaluation** 📊
- Automatic scoring for MCQs
- AI-powered evaluation for subjective answers
- Test case execution for coding questions
- Plagiarism & bot detection

### **Visual:**
- 3-step flowchart with icons
- Screenshot of JD parsing interface
- Screenshot of generated questions
- Demo video/GIF (optional)

### **Speaker Notes:**
"Here's how it works: A recruiter pastes a job description. Our AI extracts all the skills and requirements in seconds. Then it generates a complete assessment with MCQs, subjective questions, and coding challenges—all perfectly aligned with the job. When candidates take the assessment, our system automatically evaluates their answers, detects plagiarism, and flags any suspicious activity."

## 📄 **SLIDE 3: KEY FEATURES** (1.5 minutes)

### **Title:**
**"Enterprise-Grade Security Meets AI Intelligence"**

### **Content:**

**4 Key Feature Categories:**

**1. 🛡️ Anti-Cheat System**
- **Fullscreen enforcement** - Auto-enters fullscreen, warns on exit
- **Tab switching detection** - First warning, second auto-submit
- **Copy-paste blocking** - Disables clipboard, right-click
- **Keyboard shortcut blocking** - Prevents F12, Ctrl+Shift+I, etc.
- **Time anomaly detection** - Flags suspicious patterns

**2. 🔍 Resume-Skill Mismatch Detection** ⭐ **UNIQUE**
- Compares claimed skills in resume vs. assessment performance
- Automatically flags discrepancies
- Example: "Claimed React expert, scored 30%"

**3. 🤖 AI-Powered Intelligence**
- Job description parsing
- Question generation
- Subjective answer evaluation
- Plagiarism detection (text + code similarity)

**4. 📊 Comprehensive Analytics**
- Detailed candidate reports
- Skill-wise competency breakdown
- Benchmark comparison (percentile ranking)
- Export to PDF/CSV

### **Visual:**
- 4 quadrants with icons
- Screenshot of anti-cheat warnings
- Screenshot of candidate analytics dashboard
- Resume mismatch example

### **Speaker Notes:**
"Our anti-cheat system is multi-layered. When a candidate starts an assessment, they're automatically put in fullscreen mode. If they try to exit or switch tabs, they get a warning. Second attempt auto-submits and flags them. We also block copy-paste and keyboard shortcuts. But what makes us unique is our resume-skill mismatch detection—we compare what candidates claim in their resume with their actual performance, automatically flagging discrepancies. Plus, we have AI-powered plagiarism detection that checks both text and code similarity."
